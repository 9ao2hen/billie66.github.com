I attended the Coding for Fun at Exoweb office on Saturday, September 4th
2010. The event is held monthly by BLUG. It was the first BLUG activity that I
joined for the first time, so it was really meaningful. Well, this bog should
be written several days ago, it was postponed because my right eye was not
comfortable to look at the screen until today.

The event began at 11AM. I and peter went there about 9 o'clock in the
morning, but we reached the destination nearly 1PM. We were not familiar with
that region, therefore we spent most of time on the trip and little time
enjoyed our lunch.

Frankly speaking, I felt very worried when peter told me you have to introduce your
project to all the attenders in English. I didn't work on my own project those
days, and I just used QGit to learn Qt. What should I say? I thought I have
nothing to show. Peter perceived my worried mind. In order to relieve my
feeling, peter suggested me that I could say some tools that were used to
debug, manage your project. Good, I would talk something about GDB what
I was studying now.

Finally, we got to the place. The Exoweb office is not large but neat, tidy
and colorful. In the middle of the office, there is a staircase to the resting room
and meeting room. The resting room is very cute and comfortable, on the left
side a big yellow shelf filled with a lot of English technical books, several
musical instruments leaning against a sofa, and many staffs' funny portraits
on the glass wall.The office is like a home, not a company. All the people on
upstairs, were all friendly and hospitably, and we said hi to each other.

There were three foreign men who are the core members of BLUG. I knew the
handsome one is xuedi, the tall and strong one is oulo. Peter always talks
them to me. I saw them finally.

There were many blank positions in the meeting room, so we found two chairs to
sit, took laptop. The boy told us the wifi password of the office, then we
could use wireless to access web. 

New attender arrived continually. All attenders are men except me, and they talked happily.
About 4PM, a girl reached the office. I felt really happy. The girl called Rui
who has worked in IT field for six years, was interested in piano, so she was
busy with a project named drumstick which simulates piano using keyboard. The
project was really interesting. She also used Qt, but she mainly used eclipse
in windows. She told me how to install eclipse supporting C++ in ubuntu. I am
very appreciated her.

At 5PM, the event holder told us it's time to introduce your project to all
people. Oh, I felt a little worried, though people here were kind and lovely.
Everyone was required to introduce what he or she has done recently to
audiences and wrote down on the board. First, Oulo introduced himself and 
his project, in a quick way. Then is XueDi, and so on. I felt better now and 
I knew what I should say. It turned to me. I said the following words.

>My English name is Billie Jean, a song name. I have been working on a project
>named QGit. I trace my codedata with Cscope and manage my code with Git. Git
>is a really powerful tool. Ok, thanks.

After my speech, everyone gave me warm applause. It was very kind of them.I was 
very delight.

Thanks for Coding for Fun! Thanks for all the contributor to the BLUG! I learned 
so much from them. It was a really happy day and meaningful experience.
