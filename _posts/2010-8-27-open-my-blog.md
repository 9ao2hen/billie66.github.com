Well, it's a wonderful day! Finally, I open my blog in the github. I wanted to 
create a blog for a long time, especially when I saw a nice blog, but I thought 
it is too difficult to do. Luckily, thanks to open source, then there are many 
patterns to which I can refer. 

Now I only need to write my notes in terms of markdown in vim editor, nothing 
else I should care about. Though the blog isn't perfect and is simply, it is 
enough to me. I think more simpler more better, because that means I can concentrate 
on content, rather than forms.

It's really good, just think that I can share my documents and joy with others when
I own the blog.

That's all. I will often update my blog, and I will also add some small stuffs to 
decorate it and make it pretty.
