I want to access YouTube, but it is blocked in China. Is there any
methods to jump over the great firewall? Luckily, I find a good website
<http://deturl.com/> which can download videos from YouTube.

### install tool

When you open homepage of the website, click the small icon in top right corner
of the screen, then a dialog appears. If you click the add button, a search
plugin will be installed by Firefox. You can find it in the list of search engines
available in the search bar.

### search URL

After you have installed the search bar tool. The next step is to find URL of
a video that you want to download from YouTube. How should you do? You can use
a search engine that you prefer to get their URL. For example, if need some 
videos about _Git_, you just type `site: youtube git` in Google search bar,
then Google will display all the relating items. Click a proper item, a new
window will be opened. Of course, there is nothing to be displayed except some
error messages, but the selected video URL is in the address bar.

### download video

When get the right video URL, copy it from the address bar, then paste it to
the search bar of Deturl. The most important thing is to type _pwn_ before
_youtube_ in the search bar and hit enter. A web page shows up, including much
powerful function. Below the subtitle `Download the video as FLV or MP4 files`,
click `Dirpy` in the first line, the real web page where can download the video
will appear. Select a needed video format, then the video will be downloaded
from YouTube.

### enjoy it
